# images may ship no sha256 tool. Either miss prints a notice and continues —
# refusing to install because GitHub throttled us would be worse than the
# status quo. A digest we *do* obtain that does *not* match is fatal.

# that boundary is an EXDEV copy, not a rename — leaving a partially written

# download_and_replace() in crates/cli/src/verbs/selfup.rs.
