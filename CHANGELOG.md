# Changelog

Mọi thay đổi đáng kể của `8sync` ghi vào đây. Format theo [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com),
versioning theo [SemVer](https://semver.org). **8sync rule:** mỗi PR cập nhật mục `Unreleased`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.54.1] - 2026-08-09

### Security
- **`8sync up` now verifies the downloaded binary.** `install.sh` checked the release asset's
  sha256 `digest` from the GitHub API, but the recurring path the update notice steers everyone
  toward — `8sync up`, including `--to <tag>` — curled the asset and renamed it into place
  unverified. It now checks the same digest with the same semantics, deletes the temp file and
  refuses to install on a mismatch (naming expected vs actual), and never leaves an executable
  behind. When no digest is published or no `sha256sum`/`shasum`/`certutil` is on PATH it still
  upgrades — aborting would strand minimal images — but says `checksum NOT VERIFIED` out loud
  instead of looking verified. Both curl calls also gained `--proto '=https' --tlsv1.2`.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-08-09

### Security
- **Command injection in the shipped `8sync-engine.ts`.** `engine_advance` built
  `git commit -m <msg>` as a string for `bash -lc`; `JSON.stringify` escapes `"` and `\` but a
  double-quoted bash word still performs command substitution, and the message is a model-supplied
  parameter routinely paraphrased from files the agent just read. Git and gitleaks now run through
  an argv-based `runArgv` with no shell. Shell evaluation is retained only for a task's `verify`
  commands, where it is the documented contract.
- **Argument injection into `sudo pacman` / `sudo dnf`.** Profile package lists were spliced into a
  privileged argv with no end-of-options separator, so an entry beginning with `-` became a flag —
  `--hookdir=` hands alpm attacker-written root hooks, `--setopt=reposdir=` repoints dnf. Package
  names starting with `-` are now refused outright at all three privileged entry points, and the
  planners emit `--` before the package list.
- The autonomous-commit gitleaks gate no longer fails open silently: `if command -v gitleaks` exits
  0 when gitleaks is absent, so fresh machines got unscanned commits from a gate that claimed to
  scan. Presence is probed separately and an unscanned commit says so.

### Fixed — profiles a teammate never asked for
- **`--full`/`--yall`/`-y` applied the maintainer's personal `alexdev` bundle**, so a teammate
  running "install everything" got Lian Li chassis drivers, a Vietnamese IME, DisplayLink DKMS and
  Bitwarden. `--full` now means every **community** profile, read from the same
  `offered_profiles()` the y/N prompt uses. Personal profiles are reachable only via
  `--profile <name>`; `--profile alexdev` restores the old behaviour in one flag.
- `--full` also skips the `warp` VPN: a flag meaning "don't ask me" is the wrong way to acquire
  something that rewrites DNS and routing, and `--community` already documented that opt-out.
- **Profiles installed packages for hardware the machine does not have.** `apply` installs packages
  before `post_install`, so the nvidia profile's own "no NVIDIA GPU detected" guard ran far too
  late. New `requires.detect` probe is evaluated in `resolve`, per bundle member, before any
  package work; `nvidia` probes sysfs PCI vendor `0x10de` (no `lspci` dependency) and fails closed.
- A profile skipped for missing hardware is no longer recorded as applied.

### Fixed
- Line endings are now pinned to LF by `.gitattributes`. 14 embedded assets (a skill and the
  impeccable keyword rules) had CRLF committed, so the binary shipped assets whose bytes differed
  from every other asset — defeating the byte-compare that keeps user-edited files untouched and
  omp's prompt-cache prefix stable, and breaking frontmatter matching that keys on `\n`. A Windows
  checkout would have baked CRLF into every asset; the new CI `Test` step caught it.
- `Cargo.toml` version now matches the release tag, enforced by a new CI gate. Shipping 0.53.0
  under a v0.54.0 tag would have told every up-to-date user "update available" forever and made
  `8sync up` re-download the binary on every run.
- **A stale `8sync-workflow.ts` kept loading after upgrade.** The extension was retired this
  release, but nothing deleted the copy an earlier 8sync had already written to
  `~/.omp/agent/extensions/` and `<root>/.omp/extensions/`, so omp went on registering its tools
  next to the engine's. `8sync harness` (any subcommand) now removes both copies; the retired
  deploy path and its six call sites are gone.
- **Two shipped skills never deployed.** `research-paper` and `remote-compute` were added to
  `assets/skills/` but never registered in the deploy list, so `~/.omp/skills/<name>/` was never
  created on any machine — while `00-force-load.md` told the agent to open those SKILL.md files.
  Both are registered now, and a new guard test walks the embedded assets in the opposite
  direction (asset → list) so an unregistered skill dir fails the build by name; `social-growth`
  stays the single documented opt-in exception.
- **The shipped skill registry pointed at a deleted asset dir.** `assets/configs/skills.toml`
  (deployed to `~/.config/8sync/skills.toml`) still declared `src = "builtin:karpathy"` after the
  rename to `karpathy-guidelines`, so `8sync skill update` warned and skipped it on every run.
- **User-facing docs advertised 15 skills that no longer ship.** `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` and the
  docs site claimed "37 skills bundled" (and, elsewhere, 17) and named `literature-review`,
  `autoresearch` and `paper-writing` among "18 research skills" — all three directories were
  deleted, and the research set is now `deep-research`, `research-paper`, `remote-compute`. Every
  count now reads 23, matching `assets/skills/*/SKILL.md`, every named skill resolves to a real
  directory, and the two-tier force-load order (4 CORE + 6 specialist always-on) is described as
  `00-force-load.md` actually implements it. The docs site also told users to run
  `8sync skill add builtin:karpathy`, which no longer resolves.

### Added — Fedora-first package core (8sync now works on Fedora/RHEL)
- `trait PkgBackend` with `Pacman` + `Dnf` impls, selected by `env_detect::distro_family()`
  (`Family::{Arch,Fedora,Other}`, reads `ID` **and** `ID_LIKE`; Fedora 44 ships no `ID_LIKE`, so
  `ID` alone resolves). `backend()` returns `Option`, so a distro with neither manager keeps
  today's warn-and-continue instead of failing — Debian/openSUSE users are unaffected.
- Every package-manager spawn now lives **only** in `pkg.rs`. `platform::install_core_pkg` takes a
  `CorePkg { arch, fedora, brew, winget }` instead of positional strings nobody could tell apart.
- Profiles gained an **additive** `[packages.fedora]` table (`dnf`/`copr`/`rpmfusion`/`swap`)
  beside the existing `pacman`/`aur`/`aur_yay` keys, plus `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. All 37
  Fedora package names were verified against the live repos with `dnf repoquery`; profiles with no
  real rpm equivalent declare none and are skipped with a printed reason rather than guessing.
- `vpn` and `harness browser` are no longer Arch-only (Cloudflare WARP / `chromium` on Fedora);
  `clean` gained a dnf arm (`dnf clean all`, `dnf autoremove`).
- COPR is treated as third-party root code: `copr_enable` refuses any `owner/project` outside a
  checked-in allowlist unless explicitly allowed, and `dnf swap --allowerasing` prints the erase
  set first.

### Fixed
- **`8sync setup` aborted at step 3 of 8 on every non-Arch Linux.** The AUR-helper step was gated
  on `Os::Linux` instead of the Arch family, so on Fedora it failed and `try_step`'s `?`
  propagated — `codegraph`, `path-bootstrap`, `configs`, `skills` and `codegraph-skill` never ran.
  This is why `~/.omp/skills` was empty on Fedora machines.
- **Skill paths written into `AGENTS.md` were absolute to the authoring machine**
  (`/home/alexdev/...`, `/home/alexng/...`), so on any other clone omp was told to read files that
  do not exist and silently skipped the skills. `skill/inject.rs` now emits repo-relative paths for
  project skills and `~/`-anchored paths for global ones. `harness audit` could never catch this
  because it skipped every `/`-prefixed token; it now flags `/home/`, `/Users/`, `/root/` while
  still ignoring `/etc`, `/usr`, `/tmp`.
- `Dnf::install` left a half-applied batch: its plan can hold two transactions (install, then
  upgrade), and a failed upgrade returned `Err` while the committed install stayed. It now reverts
  via `dnf history undo`.
- `install.sh` created its temp file in `/tmp` (tmpfs) while installing to `~/.local/bin` (btrfs),
  so the "atomic" `mv` crossed filesystems and degraded to a copy. The temp file is now a sibling
  of the destination, matching `selfup.rs`.
- `install.ps1` hardcoded the x86_64 asset, silently giving Windows ARM64 the wrong binary.

### Changed — enforced tool routing (omp stops ignoring the code-intel stack)
- Preferring codegraph/serena/codebase-memory was previously **prose**, which omp ignores under
  load. It is now enforced by mechanisms omp implements in code: a TTSR rule
  (`condition` + `scope: "tool:grep(*), tool:glob(*)"` + `interruptMode: tool-only`) that aborts the
  stream mid-tool-call, plus `bashInterceptor` patterns closing the `bash rg` escape.
- Both are **capability-gated**: with no code-intel tool installed the rule and the interceptor
  block are removed, so a bare machine is never dead-ended. TTSR `repeatMode: once` means the worst
  case is one restarted turn, not a hard veto.
- `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` shrank 9 198 → 3 260 B (−64.6 %); it is in every prompt on every turn, and the
  TTSR rule body costs zero prompt tokens.
- Downloads are now sha256-verified using the `digest` field the GitHub Releases API already
  returns — no new dependency, no release-plumbing change.
- First tests in the repo: 48 passing (`cargo test`), covering distro parsing, the pacman argv
  regression fixture, the COPR allowlist refusal, path portability, and audit path classification.

## [0.53.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added — `8sync .` named per-project sessions (run many features at once)
- `8sync .` grew a session layer so you can keep several concurrent lines of work in one repo,
  each an isolated omp conversation. Surface (namespaced under `.`, no new top-level verbs):
  `8sync . <name>` create-or-resume · `8sync . new <name> [--worktree]` · `8sync . ls`/`--list`
  (`--json`) · `8sync . mv <old> <new>` · `8sync . rm <name> [--force]` · `8sync . merge <name>...
  [--keep-worktree]`. `8sync .` with no name resumes the last-used session (omp's default store
  when none was ever named — unchanged legacy behavior).
- Mechanism (a thin layer over omp's existing session core — not a reinvention): one omp
  `--session-dir` per name (omp's own `--continue` resumes it — zero session-id bookkeeping),
  tracked in a machine-local registry `~/.config/8sync/sessions/<repo>/index.json` that stores
  only what omp lacks (human name, worktree binding, last-used). Every launch reuses `ModelConfig`
  so STEP-0 tool-routing + advisor survive.
- `--worktree` gives a session its own `git worktree add -b 8sync/<name>` so two features edit the
  same files concurrently without collision; `ls` shows branch + dirty state.
- `merge <name>...` lands session branches into the current branch, ECC-style (affaan-m/ECC, MIT):
  read-only `git merge-tree --write-tree` conflict preflight → `git merge --no-edit` → rebase the
  conflicting worktree onto the target to unblock (auto-abort + skip on true conflict) → clean up
  merged worktree + branch + session (`--keep-worktree` to preserve). Sequential, so branch-vs-branch
  conflicts surface as the target advances. Local-only — never pushes.
- Everything runs through `git`/`omp` shell-out — **no new dependencies** (ECC's rusqlite/git2/tokio
  stack was deliberately not adopted; it would bust the size budget). `8sync doctor` reports session
  count + dirty worktrees. New module `crates/cli/src/verbs/session.rs`; `here.rs` dispatches.
- Evaluated but NOT integrated (user asked to review): linshenkx/prompt-optimizer (AGPL-3.0 +
  optimizes human prose — wrong layer) and TypeScript 7 / typescript-go (transparent to `8sync run`,
  no code change).

### Fixed — `8sync up` was Linux-only and bricked itself on Windows
- Symptom (Windows): running `8sync up` left an un-runnable file so the next `8sync` invocation popped Windows' *"Select an app to open '8sync'"* picker instead of executing. Root cause in `crates/cli/src/verbs/selfup.rs`: the self-updater hard-coded `ASSET_SUFFIX = "-linux-x86_64"` (downloaded the **Linux** binary), wrote it to `~/.local/bin/8sync` with **no `.exe`**, and replaced it with a plain `std::fs::rename` (which Windows forbids on a running `.exe`). The release CI already publishes `8sync-<tag>-windows-x86_64.exe` and `install.ps1` installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\8sync\8sync.exe`, so the updater was simply never taught about non-Linux.
- Fix — self-update is now genuinely cross-platform:
  - **Correct asset per OS/arch:** `asset_label()` maps `platform::os()` + `std::env::consts::ARCH` to the CI labels (`linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, `darwin-x86_64`, `darwin-arm64`, `windows-x86_64`; macOS ARM is `arm64`, not `aarch64`), and `asset_filename()` appends `.exe` on Windows. Both `fetch_latest_release` (auto-check + `8sync up`) and `install_tag` (`8sync up --to`) use it.
  - **Install to the running exe** via `dest_path()` = `std::env::current_exe()` (canonicalized), so `8sync up` replaces 8sync wherever it actually lives — the Unix `~/.local/bin/8sync` OR the Windows `…\Programs\8sync\8sync.exe` — instead of a hard-coded Unix path. Falls back to the legacy path only if the current exe can't be resolved.
  - **Windows-safe replace:** `download_and_replace()` renames the live `.exe` aside to `.8sync.old.<pid>` (allowed while running) before sliding the new binary in, restoring the original if the install fails; stale `.old` files are swept on the next run. Unix keeps the same-dir inode-swap rename.
- Verified: native Linux release build is clean; the `#[cfg(windows)]` branch type-checks (it uses only cross-platform `std::fs` APIs — confirmed by compiling it with the gate temporarily forced on).

### Fixed — serena's web dashboard opened a browser tab on every session start
- Symptom: a Serena dashboard tab kept reappearing (showing `Error loading configuration` / `Error loading stats`, since it races the server it is reporting on), and RAM climbed. Cause: serena ships `web_dashboard: true` **and** `web_dashboard_open_on_launch: true`, so every `start-mcp-server` binds an HTTP dashboard and pops a browser tab. omp spawns one serena per session, so this multiplies — measured here: **16 live serena processes holding 878 MB**, one dashboard each.
- Fix: `deploy::ensure_serena_mcp` now registers serena with `--enable-web-dashboard False`. The flag is passed on the **command line** rather than by editing `~/.serena/serena_config.yml`, because serena owns that file and rewrites it — a config edit alone does not survive. `register_omp_mcp`'s self-heal rewrites the existing `mcp.json` entry in place, so the fix lands on `8sync harness global` with no manual step.
- The dashboard is pure observability: serena's MCP tools are unaffected. Verified live — no listener on `24282`, and `mcp__serena_get_current_config` still answers.
- Note (not a leak): a serena pair (`uv` wrapper + python child ≈ 145 MB) is held per **live omp session**, not per project. Closing unused omp sessions is what reclaims that memory.

### Added — STEP-0 tool-routing ENFORCEMENT (`step0`): the rule is now code, not prose
- Measured problem (this machine, `8sync harness toolstats`): the STEP-0 MCP stack was connected and callable yet effectively unused — `cbm 0 · serena 0 · headroom 0` agent calls; every code lookup fell back to the built-in `read`/`grep`. Prose directives in `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`/AGENTS.md had failed to change behaviour three times (see KNOWLEDGE). Zero-friction built-ins always beat an instruction.
- **Fix — remove the fallback instead of asking nicely.** `8sync ai` / `8sync .` now launch omp with `--tools` DROPping the two redundant searchers `grep` + `glob` (`STEP0_TOOLS` in `crates/cli/src/models.rs`), so code lookup MUST flow through codegraph (CLI) · codebase-memory-mcp · serena. `--tools` is an **allowlist** (omp has no deny-list — `tools.blocked` is only a telemetry counter), so it must name every tool to keep: anything omitted is silently disabled. The list is omp's validator list minus `grep`/`glob`, and minus `computer` to preserve its default-disabled state. `lsp` is deliberately KEPT (zero-friction; serena needs `activate_project` per session). MCP/xdev tools are orthogonal to `--tools` and survive it.
- **Shell escape closed:** `deploy::ensure_bash_interceptor` writes `bashInterceptor.patterns` into `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`. omp's rule shape is `{ pattern, tool, message }`, and its matcher **skips any rule whose `tool` is not in the session's tool list** — so a rule pointing at `grep`/`glob` disables itself precisely because STEP-0 removed them. Every rule therefore points at `lsp` (always present, and the honest suggestion). Blocks `rg`/`ag`/`ack`, `grep -r`, and `find -name`; single-file and log `grep` stay allowed. Setting the key replaces omp's default array. Wired into both `global_pass` and `harness_init`.
- **Verified end-to-end on omp 17.2.9** (the previous iteration was verified only as "the string is embedded in the binary", which is why it shipped broken): the captured provider request carries 18 tools with `grep`/`glob` **absent** and `recall`/`retain`/`reflect`/`memory_edit`/`hub`/`eval`/`ast_edit`/`lsp` **present**; `8sync ai` returns normally; `rg main main.rs` is refused with `Blocked: STEP-0: …`; `grep -r main .` is refused; plain `grep main main.rs` still runs.
- **Drift guard so the allowlist cannot rot silently again** (`8sync doctor`): an allowlist fails in two directions, and both have now happened — a name omp *drops* bricks every launch, a name omp *adds* disappears from the agent with no error at all. `models::step0_tool_drift` asks omp itself (`omp --tools __8sync_probe__ -p ""` — the validator runs before any provider call, so the probe is free and offline) and diffs the answer against `STEP0_TOOLS`, reporting `REJECTED by omp: …` or `missing omp tool(s): …`. Proven in both directions: injecting `bogus_tool` produced the REJECTED warning, reverting restored `✓ STEP-0 allowlist matches omp's tool list`.
- **`codegraph callers` demoted in the STEP-0 routing** (`assets/configs/omp/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`): on a clean, freshly rebuilt full index it reported `No callers found` for a function with two real call sites, and the misses cluster by *caller* (nothing inside `global_pass` resolves) rather than by callee — `let _ =` discards are not the cause. codegraph is a prebuilt external binary with no local source, so "who calls X" now routes to `mcp__serena_find_referencing_symbols`, with `codegraph callers` allowed only as a second opinion, never as proof of absence. The same note warns against `rm -rf .codegraph`, which deletes the exclusion config and makes the next index walk ~16k files instead of ~6k.
- **Toggle (never a trap):** default ON; `8sync ai --no-step0` for one run, or `step0 = false` in `~/.config/8sync/models.toml`.
- `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` RULE #0 rewritten to match reality: states that `grep`/`glob` are gone, gives a cheapest-first routing decision tree (cbm → serena → codegraph), and **drops the stale omp-16 `mcp.discoveryDefaultServers` claim** (omp ≥17 mounts MCP as `xd://` devices — that key no longer exists).

### Fixed — STEP-0 review pass: interceptor over-block + config-migration data loss
An independent reviewer (12 min) caught defects the happy-path tests missed; all verified live.
- **grep rule blocked single-file/log grep on hyphenated names** (`grep x-ray my-report.txt`, `grep bug build-Release.log`). The `.*(-[rR])` shape matched `-r`/`-R` *inside* words. The first repair (`\s-`) then over-corrected — `grep\s+` already consumed the space, so a first-token `grep -r` stopped matching and recursive grep was *allowed through*. Final pattern uses a negative lookbehind `(?<![A-Za-z0-9-])` so the dash must be a real token boundary, and excludes double-dash long flags from the short-flag matcher (`--color`/`--directories` contain an `r` but are not recursive). Verified 19/19 cases in Python before editing source, then live both directions: `grep -r` blocked, hyphenated-name grep + `--color=auto` allowed. Same lookbehind applied to the `find`/`fd` `-name`/`-type` rule.
- **config migration silently deleted user keys** — block-end detection used `is_ascii_alphabetic()`, so a following `# comment`, `_private:`, or `'quoted':` key was swallowed into the block and overwritten on the next `8sync harness`. Now ends at any column-0 line that is not an indented continuation, and the scan is no longer single-occurrence: every `bashInterceptor:` block is enumerated and only those carrying the `STEP-0` signature are removed (any ordering; duplicates collapse), so a user-authored block is never touched. Proven by replicating the exact Rust logic in Python against a config with comment + `_key` + quoted key + user block + ours.
- **doctor surfaced only one drift direction** — an omp upgrade that renames *and* adds reports both now (`rejected` and `silently_disabled` are no longer mutually exclusive arms).
- Trims the blank line that accumulated per `8sync harness` run.
- **Second review round — the `^` anchor made the guard mostly decorative.** `^\s*grep` only fires when the tool starts the command string, so `cd src && grep -r foo .`, `cd crates/cli && rg TODO`, `LC_ALL=C grep -r`, `sudo grep -r`, `time rg`, `cat x | grep -r y` and `; do grep -r …` all escaped. Rules now match at a **command position** — `(?:^|[;&|])` plus optional `\` escape, env assignments and wrapper words. `(` is deliberately not a separator and `do`/`then` are wrappers only, so quoted prose (`git commit -m '(rg removal)'`, `echo "do rg later"`) no longer trips the rule.
- **Substitutes closed:** blocking `rg` alone just moved the habit. `git grep` (recursive by default — the obvious fallback), `egrep`/`fgrep`, bare `fd '\.rs$'` and `fd -t f`, and `find -path`/`-regex` were all open. Tools with no single-file mode worth preserving (`rg`, `fd`, `git grep`) are now blocked outright; only `grep` gets flag analysis.
- **The grep rule is quote-aware.** It walks the option cluster (a run of shell words that are neither quoted nor containing `;&|`) instead of `.*`, so a flag-looking string inside the *search pattern* no longer counts: `grep " -r " f.txt`, `grep 'make -r' build.log`, `grep -F -- -r file.txt` and `grep pat /var/log/-r-rotated.log` are allowed again, and the scan can no longer cross into the next command (`grep foo a.txt; ls -r`). 48/48 cases verified against the patterns as actually written to disk, in omp's own JS engine.
- **P1 — a user-authored `bashInterceptor:` block was being silently voided.** The code appended its own block beside the user's, assuming a duplicate top-level key would make omp fail loudly. It does not: omp parses config.yml with `Bun.YAML.parse`, which keeps the **last** key, and 8sync always appends last — so every rule the user wrote disappeared on each `8sync harness`, with no error anywhere. The function now detects a surviving user block, leaves the file untouched, and warns instead of installing.
- Fresh-machine formatting: no stray leading blank line when `config.yml` did not exist.

### Fixed — omp 17 "Failed to load extension: mutable default value must be specified as a factory"
- omp 17.2.9 added a schema validator that rejects any zod `.default(<mutable>)` where the value is an array or object literal — it must be a **factory**: `.default(() => [])`. Primitives (`false`/`0`/`""`/`3`) are unaffected. Every `omp` session printed `Warning: Failed to load extension …/8sync-engine.ts: ParseError: A mutable default value must be specified as a factory`, so none of the `engine_*` tools registered.
- One site: `assets/extensions/8sync-engine.ts:146`, `verify: z.array(z.string()).default([])` → `.default(() => [])`. `8sync-workflow.ts` had no defaults. Verified: `omp -p` in the affected project loads the extension with zero warnings. The asset is rust-embedded, so this needs `cargo build` + `8sync harness` to redeploy; live project copies were refreshed directly for immediate relief.
- Note: the separate "`omp --continue` loses chat history" report is **not** caused by this — omp continues past extension-load failures. It is a distinct omp-17 symptom; retest `--continue` after this fix and diagnose separately if it persists.

### Changed — CI: `aarch64` builds without Docker, and the size budget is now enforced
- **`cross` → `cargo-zigbuild`** for `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`. This fixes a correctness bug, not just speed: `cross` ran inside a Docker image with no JS toolchain, so `build.rs` could not build the Vite dashboard and **silently embedded the stub page** into that asset. zigbuild runs on the runner, where `npm` exists. Verified locally (zig 0.16.0 + cargo-zigbuild 0.23.0): 31.9 s → statically linked aarch64 ELF, **4 151 328 B — already under the 4 MiB goal**.
- **New `scripts/size-gate.sh`**, run on every release asset: hard-fails above a **5 MiB ceiling**, warns above the **4 MiB goal**. `AGENTS.md` §8 carried a budget nothing enforced, which is how the binary drifted 52 % over unnoticed. The ceiling sits above today's size on purpose — a gate that is already red gets ignored — and ratchets down as `size-report.sh` shows headroom. Both directions tested.
- **`universal2` rejected** (reversing the earlier proposal): a fat macOS binary makes every Mac user download both slices — the opposite of the goal — and would rename assets `install.sh` resolves by `${os}-${arch}`.

### Fixed — a directory merely *named* `su-code` made its parent look like a project
- `discover::detect_current_project_root` and `harness global`'s project test accepted any folder called `su-code` as proof of an omp project. Since this repo's own checkout is `~/Projects/tools/su-code`, an auto-stamp run from `~/Projects/tools` wrote a blank memory tree (`STATE.md`, `KNOWLEDGE.md`, `PLAYBOOKS.md`, …) **plus a 74-entry `skills/` tree into the repo root**.
- Both paths now share `discover::is_omp_project`, and the `su-code` marker requires the directory to actually contain memory (`skills/` or one of `STATE.md`/`KNOWLEDGE.md`/`PROJECT.md`/`PLAYBOOKS.md`/`skills.toml`). Verified three ways: a bare `su-code/` dir is left alone, an `AGENTS.md` repo is still stamped, and a memory tree without `AGENTS.md` is still detected.

### Changed — **binary is 24 % smaller**: 6 407 848 → 4 859 696 B, no feature removed (`lean-binary` M2)
- **Dropped `rusqlite` (−1 035 384 B).** `harness toolstats` never needed a database: its ingest opened with `DELETE FROM calls` and re-parsed every session JSONL on each run, so nothing ever persisted — 1 MB of embedded SQLite C answered `COUNT`/`GROUP BY` over rows the same process had just built. Now a single in-memory pass. Output is **byte-identical**, proven by running the old and new binaries against a frozen copy of the session tree; only the provenance line changed (`→ …/toolstats.db` became `← …/sessions/<slug>`). SQLite left `ORDER BY` ties in table-scan order, so ranking tie-breaks on first appearance to preserve it.
- **Replaced `elkjs` with `@dagrejs/dagre` (−512 768 B).** `elk.bundled.js` was 1 606 238 B of the 1 891 858 B dashboard chunk — 85 % of the frontend was a GWT-compiled Java layout engine serving two `layered` calls. New `web/src/layout.ts`; bundle down to 478 704 B (−75 %). A lazy `import()` was measured first and rejected: `rust-embed` embeds the whole `web/dist` tree, so chunk-splitting saves zero binary bytes. Verified headless — codegraph lays out in four clean LR ranks, workflow auto-layout chains top-down, zero page errors.
- **`toolstats` feature flag removed** — it guarded only `rusqlite`. `features` is now just `web`; a `--no-default-features` build *gains* the tracker and sits at 3 109 496 B, **25.86 % under the 4 MiB budget**.
- `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` size and tracker claims replaced with measured numbers.

### Added — `lean-binary` feature scope (GSD planning tree): M0 + M1 landed
- `su-code/planning/lean-binary/` — 4-phase roadmap to bring the binary back under the `AGENTS.md` §8 "< 4 MB" budget **without dropping a user-visible feature**: M0 land pending WIP · M1 feature gating + per-gate byte attribution · M2 eliminate rather than gate · M3 CI (`cargo-zigbuild` `aarch64-musl`, macOS `universal2`) + budget truth.
- **M0 PASS.** Baseline **6 407 848 B** vs the 4 194 304 B budget. Every commit in the range was replayed in a throwaway `git worktree` and built from scratch — 4/4 green — because `engine_verify` only ever sees the working tree.
- **M1 PASS (8/8 AC).** `crates/cli/Cargo.toml` gets its first `[features]` table: `default = ["web","toolstats"]`, `web` = axum + tokio + tower-http + scraper, `toolstats` = rusqlite. `marketplace` folds into `web` (single caller: `/api/marketplace`). A `--no-default-features` build now compiles **and runs**, warning-clean, with no JS toolchain — `build.rs` skips the Vite bundle when `CARGO_FEATURE_WEB` is unset. Gated subcommands say `rebuild with --features web` instead of failing as unknown.
- **New `scripts/size-report.sh`** — A/Bs four feature combinations into separate `--target-dir`s. Measured: full **6 407 144** · web-only 5 346 304 · toolstats-only **4 144 576** · minimal **3 081 416**. Per-gate cost: `web` **2 262 568 B**, `toolstats` **1 060 840 B**.
- **`cargo bloat` was wrong by ~26×** on SQLite (40 KiB claimed vs 1 060 840 B measured) — it attributes `.text` by symbol and is blind to `.rodata` and C blobs. Ranking tool only; every load-bearing number now comes from an A/B build.

### Added — `deep-research` §5 "Native & Binary-Weight Audits" + a measured audit of `8sync` itself
- `assets/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md` gains a 7-step protocol for native/binary-weight research: ground with `size -A`, attribute with `cargo bloat --crates` (and chase its `[Unknown]` C row through `build/*/out/*.a`), A/B every proposed flag into a scratch `--target-dir` with an explicit `--target`, record falsified knobs as `failure:` entries, trace surprise deps with `cargo tree -i`, prefer `[features]` gating over rewrites, and reach for Zig only as build tooling.
- Applied it to this repo — brief at `outputs/native-tooling-zig-rust.md` (+ plan/drafts/provenance). Headline: the binary is **6 406 696 B (6.11 MiB)** against the `AGENTS.md` §8 "< 4 MB" budget, and the cause is that `crates/cli/Cargo.toml` has **no `[features]` section** — `harness web` (axum/tokio/hyper), marketplace scraping (scraper/html5ever) and `harness toolstats` (bundled SQLite, 2.1 MB `.a`) link into every build, alongside 4.9 MB of embedded assets (`web/dist` 1.9 MB, `impeccable/scripts` 1.6 MB).
- Release-profile knobs proven exhausted by A/B: `opt-level="s"` is **+307 392 B** vs `"z"`; `-C force-unwind-tables=no` saves **704 B**; `-C relocation-model=static` breaks proc-macro builds. No profile change made.

### Added — `branch-sync` skill & automated script for zero-conflict multi-branch sync
- **`/sync-pr` slash command**: Deployed globally (`~/.omp/agent/commands/sync-pr.md`) and per-project (`.omp/commands/sync-pr.md`). Invoking `/sync-pr [<branch>]` in any omp session automatically loads the `branch-sync` skill, audits all local/remote branches, deep-previews and safely merges specified feature branches to `main`, and synchronizes all active branches to match latest `main` with zero conflicts.
- New skill `assets/skills/branch-sync/SKILL.md` + helper script `assets/skills/branch-sync/scripts/branch_sync.py`: provides complete audit, deep-preview (`git diff main...<branch>`, commit breakdown, conflict dry-run), safe merge to `main`, and zero-conflict multi-branch synchronization across all active local/remote branches without risk of merge conflict leaks or data loss.

### Enhanced — `8sync harness global` auto-detection for `su-code/` projects
- `8sync harness global` now automatically detects if the current working directory is an `omp` project (containing `su-code/` or `AGENTS.md`) and stamps its per-project harness layer (vendors global skills into `su-code/skills/`, injects `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, seeds memory, installs pre-commit hook, and initializes `codegraph`) without requiring manual `--sweep`.

### Enhanced — `deep-research` skill with AI Agent loop engineering & design patterns
- Deepened `assets/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`: incorporates state-machine loop engineering (Plan → Execute → Verify → Advance), STEP-0 code intelligence (`codegraph`, `codebase-memory-mcp`, `serena`), multi-agent wave execution (`tasks[]`), headroom output compression, modality-fit vision routing, and ponytail YAGNI discipline for large real-world codebases.

### Added — `8sync omp update` verb (update omp + auto-repair a blocked install)
- New verb `crates/cli/src/verbs/omp.rs` (`8sync omp update`, `--force`): runs `omp update`
  and, when it fails with `npm error EEXIST … ~/.local/bin/omp` or bun `Fail extracting
  tarball`, auto-repairs — backs up the current binary, clears the standalone file squatting
  the symlink path, `npm install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent@latest`, then re-resolves and
  reports `CURRENT → NEW`. Runs from the SHELL (not an omp `/command`) so it works even when
  omp is broken; native Rust, no `sudo`/system-pkg/git. `8sync up` note now points here.
- Verified live both paths: normal ("Already up to date" @ 17.0.7) and `--force` (backup → rm
  → npm reinstall → `~/.local/bin/omp` healthy `node_modules` symlink). Root cause: omp ships
  as a standalone binary that squats the bin path where the package manager wants a symlink.

### Added — Lark (larksuite) to the `apps-personal` profile
- `assets/profiles/apps-personal.toml` now installs Lark via AUR `larksuite-bin`
  (v7.66.11, URL larksuite.com) alongside Bitwarden. AUR bin package auto-fetches the
  official `.deb` at build time and is pacman-tracked — the 437 MB binary is NEVER
  committed to the repo/GitHub, only the download reference. Sets `requires.aur_helper`.
  China build (Feishu) is a separate package, `feishu-bin`. Opt-in; the `alexdev`
  bundle intentionally excludes `apps-personal`.

### Fixed — STEP-0 MCP tools were connected but NEVER called (0.09% usage) → always visible
- Root cause (measured over 29 omp sessions / 13,854 tool calls: serena 0 · headroom 0 ·
  cbm 10 · zai 3 calls; `search_tool_bm25` taken 2×): omp's default
  `tools.discoveryMode: auto` hides ALL MCP tools behind a `search_tool_bm25` discovery
  hop once the registry exceeds 40 tools (this stack registers 48), and every instruction
  surface taught BASE tool names (`search_graph`, `find_symbol`) that are not callable —
  the registered forms are `mcp__codebase_memory_mcp_search_graph`, `mcp__serena_find_symbol`, ….
- Fix: `8sync harness`/`harness global` now writes `mcp.discoveryDefaultServers:
  [codebase-memory-mcp, headroom, serena, zai-vision]` into `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`
  (`ensure_mcp_tools_visible` in `crates/cli/src/verbs/skill/deploy.rs`) — the four
  harness servers' full catalogs stay in the active tool set, zero discovery hops.
  Key-presence idempotent; never overrides a user-set value. NOTE:
  `tools.essentialOverride` does NOT work for MCP (omp filters entries to built-in
  tool names only — verified in omp 16.4.8 bundle); an inert pin block from that
  approach is auto-migrated away (byte-exact match only).
- Instruction surfaces now teach the REGISTERED `mcp__…` names + the
  `search_tool_bm25` escape hatch for other/new servers: `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` RULE #0,
  `00-force-load.md`, the AGENTS.md STEP-0 sentinel template (`inject.rs`), the
  capabilities catalog header, and the feature-skill R10 literals (assets + su-code
  mirror). Stale names dropped everywhere: `semantic_query` (never existed on cbm),
  `codegraph search/deps/defs` (real 1.1.2 verbs: `query/explore/node/callers/callees/impact`).
  Unfollowable headroom mandate ("compress before it enters context") rewritten to the
  followable form: compress what YOU re-emit (`mcp__headroom_compress`).
- `8sync doctor` now flags hidden MCP tools (`discoveryDefaultServers` missing) and a
  dead serena (mcp.json + uvx check). Live probe verified: `omp -p` calls
  `mcp__codebase_memory_mcp_search_graph` and `mcp__serena_find_symbol` directly — both OK,
  no discovery hop; toolstats records serena/cbm optimizer calls for the first time.

### Fixed — omp ≥17 dropped bm25 discovery; the recurring "MCP HIDDEN" was a phantom
- omp 17.x replaced the pre-17 tool-discovery model (the `search_tool_bm25` hop +
  `mcp.discoveryDefaultServers`) with `tools.xdev` (default on): MCP tools mount as
  `xd://mcp__…` device URLs, callable via read/write without shipping schemas every
  request. `discoveryDefaultServers` is gone from omp's settings schema — writing it is
  a no-op that omp strips on the next config rewrite. That churn is exactly why STEP-0
  looked like it "regressed" after every omp self-upgrade (upgrade resets `config.yml`
  → doctor's string-check screamed HIDDEN → re-harness → repeat), while the tools were
  callable all along (verified live via `xd://mcp__codebase_memory_mcp_*` this session).
- `ensure_mcp_tools_visible` (`deploy.rs`) now detects omp ≥17 and skips the dead key
  (nothing to configure — `tools.xdev` mounts them); pre-17 keeps the discoveryDefaultServers write.
- `8sync doctor` MCP check is omp-version-aware: omp ≥17 reports the xd:// mount (OK)
  instead of the false "HIDDEN behind search_tool_bm25" warning; the `harness global`
  summary bullet updated to match. New `env_detect::omp_major()` parses omp's major version.

### Added — omp `/push-now` command (cross-machine handoff + commit + push)
- New embedded command `assets/commands/push-now.md`, deployed by `8sync harness`
  (`ensure_engine` in `crates/cli/src/verbs/skill/deploy.rs`) to
  `~/.omp/agent/commands/push-now.md` (global) + `<repo>/.omp/commands/push-now.md`
  (project), alongside `/auto` and `/feature`. `/push-now [msg]` is the
  "I'm switching machines right now" verb: it rewrites `su-code/STATE.md` with a
  cold-resume handoff (branch/HEAD, what changed this session, done/next/blockers,
  new-machine runbook), updates `CHANGELOG.md`/`KNOWLEDGE.md` if code changed, then
  `git add -A` + commit (gitleaks-gated, no `--no-verify` past a real secret) +
  `git push` origin current branch. No PR, no branch switch, no tag bump, no
  force-push (that's `8sync ship` / a release). Since it's in `assets/`, a fresh
  machine gets it automatically after `git pull && bash scripts/bootstrap.sh && 8sync harness`.

### Added — omp `/pull-now` command (cold-resume: pull + orient + prepare)
- New embedded command `assets/commands/pull-now.md`, deployed by `8sync harness`
  the same way (`ensure_engine`) to `~/.omp/agent/commands/pull-now.md` +
  `<repo>/.omp/commands/pull-now.md`. `/pull-now [go]` is the **receiving end of
  `/push-now`**: safe `git pull` (ff-only → rebase on divergence; stop on conflict
  or dirty tree), then read `su-code/STATE.md` HANDOFF + recent `KNOWLEDGE.md`
  learnings + `CHANGELOG.md`/`git log` to understand exactly where the project is,
  prepare the workspace (rebuild + `8sync harness` if `crates/`/`assets/` changed,
  verify the per-machine gotchas the handoff listed, `8sync doctor`), and report
  current state + the single next concrete action. `go` = start that action;
  empty = orient + prepare, then STOP for the human. No push, no clobber.

Older releases (0.52.0 and down) live in [CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md](CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md).
